# Bitter Sweet â€” Project Context

**Bitter Sweet** is a physical narrative decision-making game where players embody a female character navigating adulthood from ages 25â€“35. Each year, players draw a **scenario card** that presents a personal dilemma with two options. Each option has an emotional or logistical **consequence**, represented by:

- ðŸª¶ **Light object** = Minor weight or positive outcome  
- ðŸ§± **Medium object** = Moderate emotional/logistical burden  
- ðŸª¨ **Heavy object** = Significant impact (e.g., burnout, guilt, loneliness)

The playerâ€™s choices accumulate into a reflective emotional journey.

## MVP Companion App Goal

Build a mobile-friendly web prototype that replaces printed scenario cards with dynamically generated ones using GPT-4. The app should:

- Let users input:
  - Character name (e.g. Mila, Lucy, etc.)
  - Age (25â€“35)
- Generate:
  - A short life dilemma
  - Two distinct choices
  - Consequences for each choice
  - Emotional weight for each consequence (Light, Medium, or Heavy)
